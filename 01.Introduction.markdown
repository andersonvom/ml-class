## Introduction

### Examples

* Database mining: go through large datasets, like web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
* Applications that cannot be programmed by hand, like autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision
* Self-customizing programs, like amazon, netflix recommendations.
* Understand human learning (brain, real AI)

### What is Machine Learning

* Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
* A computer is said to learn if it can improve its performance in a given task through experience. Example: classifying emails as spam or not spam, according to whether a user marks the emails as spam or not. The percentage of emails correctly classified would be its performance.

### Types of algorithms

* Supervised: it is tought how to learn
* Unsupervised: it learns by itself
* Others: reincorcement learning, recommender systems. Less used.

### Supervised Learning

* The right answers are given. Ex.: in a dataset of housing prices, all prices reflect real (correct) values.
* Regression is used to predict continuous valued output (e.g. price, how many items in an inventory will be sold over the next three months)
* Classification is used for discrete output (e.g. 0 or 1, or a discrete set, whether each account has been hacked or not)

### Unsupervised Learning

* The right answer is unknown even to the programmer
* Clustering algorithms (i.e. group large sets into smaller subsets)
* Examples: find different market groups in a large customer set, group similar news.
